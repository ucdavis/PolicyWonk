## Setting up a Dev Environment

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- Install [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

### Setup Steps

1. Set up the frontend environment file by copying the `.env.local` file from LastPass to `web/.env.local`
2. Set up backend environment file by copying `backend/.env.example` to `/backend/.env`. If using the shared TEST pgsql instance then uncomment the line with the TEST connection string and add the password from one pass.
3. From VS Code, open a terminal in the dev container. You may have to close and re-open the workspace to register the dev environment.
4. From the dev container terminal, generate the prisma client:

```
npx prisma generate
```

5. Start the application

```
npm run dev
```

6. Access the application at `localhost:3001`
